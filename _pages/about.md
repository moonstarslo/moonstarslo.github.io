I'm a fifth-year Phd student in Xi'an Jiaotong University. My research interest includes novel computer architecture for emerging applications and performance modeling and optimization of graph applications.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof.Pengju Ren](https://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/web/pengjuren) of CAG lab in Xi'an Jiaotong University.
