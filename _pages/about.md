I'm a fifth-year Phd student from Xi'an Jiaotong University in China. My research interest includes novel computer architecture for emerging applications and performance modeling and optimization of graph applications.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof.Pengju Ren]() of CAG lab from Xi'an Jiaotong University.
